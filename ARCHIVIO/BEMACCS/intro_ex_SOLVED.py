    a5 = a[n-1-n%2::-2]     # odd-indexed values, in reverse. We need to start from the last odd index!

      # explanation: consider `a4`. If `n` is even, the last index is `n-1`, which is odd, and then we need
      #     to start from `n-2` since we want the last even index. If `n` is odd, however, the last element
      #     `n-1` is even, which is what we want. The expression `n%2` is 0 for even `n` and 1 for odd `n`.
      #     Therefore, the expression `(1-n%2)` is 1 for even `n` and 0 for odd `n`. Therefore, we can
      #     say that in general we want to start from `n-1-(1-n%2)`, which simplifies to `n-2+n%2`.
      #
      #     now consider `a5`. It's the same except that we want to start from `n-1` if `n` is even, and
      #     from `n-2` if `n` is odd (the opposite of the previous case). So instead of subtracting `(1-n%2)`
      #     we just subtract `n%2`. The resulting expression is `n-1-n%2`.

    ## the result is also the same as this (but performed more efficiently):
    # s = [0, n//2, n-1]

    # In fact, we can do the same check as above in one line, although a little obfuscated
    assert np.array_equal(a1, np.array([a[inds[i]] for i in range(m)]))

    # Well, the above line can be made even shorter: if we don't explicitly construct an array
    # and compare `a1` with `somelist`, then `somelist` will be automatically converted into an
    # array anyway... (this is true even when you use `==`, e.g. if you did

    ##              using a bool mask inside an indexing expression returns only those elements where the mask
    ##              is True. So in this case only the non-negative elements.

    #   of the same length, the effect is that each element will be chosen

    z = (x - mu) / sigma

    t1 = n * m
    # total number of elements of the even-indexed sub-table
    # (notice the integer divisions!)
    t2 = (n // 2) * (m // 2)

    # prepare two arrays for collecting the samples
    # (this is because we should always try to avoid growing arrays
    # dynamically if possible!)
    m1 = np.zeros(samples)
    m2 = np.zeros(samples)
    for i in range(samples):
        # generate the random table with Gaussian entries

    ## Now that we have collected the results, we can plot some histograms

    # clear up previous plots, so that we can call this function repeatedly
    plt.clf()
    # plot the two histograms

    # note that we can use the `gaussian` function over the `x1` array directly,
    # since in that function we used the numpy version of `sqrt` and `exp` (and
    # no `for` loops)

    #  very nice)

    a[ ::2,  ::2] = 0  # set the even rows/cols
    a[1::2, 1::2] = 0  # set the odd rows/cols

    ## [Extra puzzle]
    ## if `a` is not a view and if the number of columns of `a` is odd,
    ## we can use a trick. To check whether `a` owns its own data
    ## (is not a view), we need to check the `.base` attribute. Actually,
    ## we also should check that the internal layout is C-like (i.e. row-major),
    ## which can be read out from an internal flag.

    # if a.base is None and a.shape[1] % 2 == 1 and a.flags.c_contiguous:
    #     a.ravel()[::2] = 0

    ## Note: if `a` is a view, nasty/unexpected things could happen...

## 25. Sieve of Eratosthenes (II) - Advanced

def ex25_sieve2(n):

        i = np.argmax(a[i+1:]) + i + 1        # This time, we find the next prime and advance more quickly

    ## Explanation of the last line:
    ##   we have just decided that `i` is prime. Then `a[i+1:]` is a view of
    ##   everything that follows. Calling `argmax` on that returns the position
    ##   of the first element that is `True`, because in a bool array the max
    ##   is always `True` and argmax returns the first occurrence of the max.
    ##   (So this is basically just an ugly trick...)
    ##   The reason for adding `i+1` is that `argmax` will return the index of
    ##   the first `True` in the view. But the view starts from `i+1`. So to get
    ##   the index of the same element in the original array we need to shift it.

## 26. Conway's game of life - Very advanced (!)

# First version (a little more intuitive).

# the beginning.

# Second version (a little more numpy-ish; much faster for large n)
#
# This computes the neighbors all at once in a separate array.
# It does this by summing the configuration c shifted by 1 cell in one
# of eight possible directions (north-west, north, nort-east, west, east,
# south-west, south, south-east).
# The problems come from the indices, which are a bit tricky.
#
# At the end, the game of life rules are implemented by filtering the neighbors
# array through some conditions (e.g. neighb == 3) and then applying those
# rules where appropriate by logical operations (The symbol `|` denotes an `or`
# operation; the symbol `&` an `and` operation, the symbol `~` a `not`
# operation). Note that this goes through the creation of some temporary
# arrays, therefore speed could be improved further by avoiding that.
