    "Object oriented programming is the process of modelling real world objects in code. Real world objects have attributes (height, weight and name) and capabilities (talk,walk and eat). We model attributes with fields and capabilities with methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is basically a blueprint, from which you can create objects. Classes define an object, something you basically want standardised (e.g. a person) that allows you to use them to pass into functions, depending on what you want them to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a class doesn't represent a particular object, it's just the blueprint from which an object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to create a class (i.e. define a blueprint for an object) you'll have to give it some attributes (what an object is), and methods (what an object does).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- variables in an object are called: \n",
    "\t- instance variables OR\n",
    "\t- instance attributes\n",
    "- and functions within an object are called: \n",
    "\t-  methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- we need a special method called __init__ : \n",
    "\t- you will use this to refer to the class with:\n",
    "\t-  def __init__(self, param1, param2):\n",
    "\t\tself.param1 = param1\n",
    "\t\tself.param2 = param2\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also parent classes, and child classes. Child classes take all the attributes used by the parent class, but you can add specific attributes or methods to this sub-class. Method overriding is the process of naming the same method in the child class, but with a different functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "when you have different class objects using the same methods, you can call them without having to refer to their class "
