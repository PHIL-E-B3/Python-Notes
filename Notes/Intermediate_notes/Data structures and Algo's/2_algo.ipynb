    "The inner loop starts comparing indices from the beginning.\n",
    "If the element at the current index is greater than the element at the next index, the two elements are swapped.\n",
    "When the inner loop completes, the largest number from the unsorted portion is at the end of the list.\n",

    "The function bubble_sort() is provided to sort the list list_1.\n",

    "The inner loop runs with decreasing length because, with each iteration of the outer loop, one more element is placed in its correct position at the end of the list.\n",
